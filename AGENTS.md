# Shared project rules

- Communicate in Czech during conversation, unless the task says otherwise.
  This rule covers conversation only — written documentation (this file and
  all other `.md` files in the project) is in English.
- Read related files and the public API before changing code (see
  `PRINCIPLES.md` P7).
- Keep a unified interface for Codex and Claude wherever possible.
- Keep provider-specific details hidden inside the implementation layer.
- Never store passwords, tokens, or credentials in the repository.
- Only provider login may be interactive; nothing else should require
  confirmation.
- The project's long-term state lives in the `memory/` directory.
- Agents' private profiles, memory, and commands live in `agents/<name>/`.
- The actual application code being built through this pipeline lives in
  `project/`, kept separate from this agentic framework/governance layer
  (`agents/agent.py`, `agents/agent_profile.py`, `agents/contract_workflow.py`,
  `agents/git_ops.py`, `agents/pipeline.py`, `agents/<name>/`, `memory/`,
  `contracts/`, `AGENTS.md`, `PRINCIPLES.md`, and the single root entry
  point `chat_architect.py` — see ADR-021). This repository itself is the
  reusable starting state ("point zero") copied for each new project — see
  ADR-015.
- `source/` holds the original/input source code of an existing project
  being migrated onto this pipeline — read-only reference, never edited
  directly; migrated/new code lands in `project/` instead — see ADR-024.
- After cloning this template for a new project, fill in `GIT_REPO` in
  `.env` with that project's own repository — `chat_architect.py`
  redirects `origin` there automatically on startup (see ADR-026).
  `commit_and_push()` refuses to push while `origin` still matches an
  entry in `memory/TEMPLATE_ORIGINS.md` regardless (ADR-025), so a
  forgotten `GIT_REPO` blocks the pipeline instead of pushing into the
  template — see the root README's "Starting a new project from this
  template".
- The repository root has exactly one `.py` file, `chat_architect.py` —
  the only way to run the pipeline. Everything else the framework needs is
  a module under `agents/` (see ADR-021).
- The repository root does not grow new files as the framework grows.
  `AGENTS.md`, `PRINCIPLES.md`, `README.md`, `AGENTS_SUGGESTIONS.md`,
  `UPDATE_NOTES.md`, `requirements.txt`, `.env`/`.env.example`, and
  `chat_architect.py` are the fixed set. A new piece of framework state
  or config belongs in `memory/` (state, e.g. `TEMPLATE_ORIGINS.md`),
  under `agents/` (code or agent-specific files), or as a new section in
  an existing root `.md` file — never a new top-level file (see ADR-027).
- Once `project/` holds real code (not just a placeholder), contract work
  is implemented in `project/` by default. Touching the framework layer
  (`agents/*.py`, `chat_architect.py`) or a governance `.md` file
  (`AGENTS.md`, `PRINCIPLES.md`, `ROLE.md`, `COMMANDS.md`) is in scope only
  when the contract explicitly calls for it. Reading files outside
  `project/` to understand context is always allowed — this restricts
  writes, not reads. When in doubt, a change outside `project/` needs its
  own contract point, not silent inclusion (see ADR-022).

## Naming convention (see ADR-008)

- Directories and source/code files: `lowercase_with_underscores`
  (e.g. `chat_architect.py`, `agents/contract_workflow.py`, `agents/reviewer/`).
- Document `.md` files that carry a rule, role, state, or contract (not
  free-form text): `UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES.md` (e.g. `ROLE.md`,
  `AGENTS.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_CONTRACT_0001.md`). `README.md`
  naturally fits the pattern.
- No diacritics in any file name, directory name, or identifier (variable,
  function, class) — ASCII only. This rule applies only to names; prose in
  documents, comments, and commit messages may and should use Czech
  diacritics (see "Communicate in Czech" above).
- No hyphens in file or directory names — use `_` instead of `-`.
- Numbered contracts: four digits, zero-padded, never reused
  (`IMPLEMENTATION_CONTRACT_0001.md`, `0002.md`, ...).

## Contract workflow

- Significant implementation work must have a
  `contracts/IMPLEMENTATION_CONTRACT_NNNN.md` file. See "Light path for
  small fixes" below for what counts as "significant".
- The architect prepares the requirements. Both review gates —
  architecture review BEFORE implementation and implementation review
  (point by point, plus an explicit Out of Scope check) AFTER
  implementation — are run independently by the `reviewer`; the architect
  never approves its own proposal or verifies its own implementation
  (Tr5-base decision 1). After implementation review, the architect's pass
  over the result is non-gating — a strategic-fit read, not a second
  approval.
- The programmer implements only the points of a contract that has passed
  architecture review with verdict `ACCEPTED`.
- The contract's status and `handoff_to` determine who continues.
- The host application writes notifications to `agents/<agent>/INBOX.md`.
- Permanent findings from review are written only to allowed memory files.
- The history of both review gates is append-only — a new round is added,
  the old one is never overwritten or deleted.

## Light path for small fixes (see `PRINCIPLES.md` P14, ADR-006)

Not every change needs a contract. Process weight should match decision
weight — the full contract cycle protects structural, hard-to-reverse
decisions; enforcing it on a typo would only slow the workflow down, not
protect anything.

The following may be fixed directly without a contract (by anyone — human
or agent):

- typos and formatting,
- broken or dead links,
- clearly incorrect text in a comment, in documentation, or in a `README`,
- any other mechanical fix that does not change behavior, the public API,
  or the structure.

Condition: such a fix must not introduce a new abstraction, function, file,
or dependency, nor change the behavior or output of the code. As soon as it
does (even a little), it needs a contract — when in doubt, choose the
contract, not the light path.

Every fix made this way is logged as one line in `memory/CHANGE_LOG.md`
(what was fixed, where, by whom) — otherwise it stays invisible to the next
review, the same way an uncommitted change does above.

## Principles

The project's operating principles (adopted from the Tr5 Platform and
generalized, plus this project's own — see ADR-005 and ADR-011) live in
`PRINCIPLES.md`, not here. That file is loaded in full into every agent's
instructions.
