Talk to the architect directly — plain text goes straight to them.

Commands available alongside the conversation:
  /new <topic>       drafts a new contract; the pipeline then runs on its
                      own (architecture review, and if accepted,
                      implementation and implementation review) and stops
                      once it returns to the architect
  /revise <n> <topic> rewrites contract <n>'s requirements after
                      CHANGES_REQUESTED and continues the same way
  /work [n]         manual override: programmer picks up contract <n> (or
                      the next ready one)
  /review [n]       manual override: architect runs implementation review
                      on contract <n> (or the next ready one)
  /commit <n>       after agreeing the implementation is sufficient,
                      commits and pushes contract <n> (must be APPROVED)
  /status           shows the contract queue
  /inbox            shows the architect's inbox
  /help             shows this help
  /exit             exits
