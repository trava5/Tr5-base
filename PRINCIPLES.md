# Tr5-base Principles

Status: Living Document

## Purpose

This document collects the operating principles of this project, bootstrapped
from `agentCodex`'s own `PRINCIPLES.md` (see ADR-005) and further enriched
with mechanisms proven in the Tr5 Platform (see ADR-028 onward). Principles
are adopted from either source where they apply, generalized to this
project's own architecture, and otherwise added as this project accumulates
its own experience. Numbering is local to this document and assigned in the
order a principle is adopted here — it does not necessarily match the source
principle's number in `agentCodex` or Tr5.

A principle exists here because it was agreed as a real, applicable rule for
this project, not because it sounded generally right in the source material.

## Revision Process

Each principle carries a `Status` field:

- **Active** — currently guiding decisions, no revision needed.
- **Under Review** — a recent case raised doubt; being reconsidered.
- **Revised** — superseded by a newer formulation (link to replacement).
- **Deprecated** — no longer applies; kept for historical record.

Principles are never silently deleted or renumbered. A deprecated or revised
principle stays in this document with a reason, so a later reader understands
why something that once made sense no longer does.

### When a principle gets reconsidered

Not on a fixed schedule, and not by auditing every principle after every
contract — that would itself violate P14/P15. A principle is reconsidered
when a real contract (typically during implementation review, sometimes
architecture review) actually runs into a conflict with it or a case it
does not cover, the same way Tr5's own P19-P24 were each extracted from a
specific incident, not from a review calendar.

When that happens: the reviewing agent (the reviewer, for either gate) may
propose an entry to `PRINCIPLES.md` via
`memory_updates` (allowed since `PRINCIPLES.md` is in
`ALLOWED_MEMORY_TARGETS` — see ADR-014), describing the conflict and which
principle it concerns. This is appended, not a direct edit to the
principle's own `Status` field — `append_memory()` only appends a
timestamped entry. Formalizing the actual status change (`Active` →
`Under Review` → `Revised`/back to `Active`) and rewriting the principle's
own text is done deliberately afterward, referencing that entry, the same
way this document's own principles were drafted in conversation rather than
auto-generated.

## How agents use this file

The full content of this file is loaded into every agent's instructions
(see `agent_profile.py::build_agent_instructions`), the same way `ROLE.md` is
— so it does not depend on whether a given provider's SDK loads `AGENTS.md`
automatically.

## Principles

### P1 — Architecture defines direction. Implementation reflects today's understanding.
Status: Active
Source: Tr5 P1 + P2 (merged)

A contract may anticipate future evolution (in its "Future Evolution"
section). An implementation never does. No point of a contract, and no line
of its implementation, includes a capability that today's request did not
actually ask for — even if it seems obviously useful later.

### P2 — Verify deferred imports too, not just module-level ones.
Status: Active
Source: Tr5 P19

Checking dependencies only via `import`/`from` at the top of a file can miss
a library imported inside a function — the module then imports cleanly and
only fails at the actual call, with a real request waiting on an answer.

### P3 — An uncommitted local fix is invisible to the next review.
Status: Active
Source: Tr5 P20

Review always starts from a clean clone/state of the repository — anything
fixed locally and not committed does not exist from its point of view, and
can be silently overwritten by another change without anyone noticing.
Commit and push every verified fix before moving on to the next step.

### P4 — Verification isolated from real external systems must be structurally tied to that isolation, not just instructed.
Status: Active
Source: Tr5 P21

"Don't use the real key/DB" describes intent, not a mechanism — safe
isolation requires an explicit injected fake dependency, or another path
where there is no reachable code path to real credentials at all, not
relying on a test simply "not connecting".

### P5 — A gitignore entry for a sensitive or temporary path is an acceptance criterion of the change that introduces it.
Status: Active
Source: Tr5 P24

As soon as a contract or commit introduces a new default path for
credentials, tokens, or test/temporary output, verifying `.gitignore`
coverage belongs to that same step — not a separate cleanup task noticed
later.

### P6 — A contract's "Current State" contains facts, never interpretations.
Status: Active
Source: Tr5 P4

"Current State" describes only what already exists today — names, paths,
interfaces, behavior — established by reading the actual code. It never
contains a proposal, a wish, or a justification for changing something;
that belongs in "Purpose"/"Intent" instead. (Tr5 P3, on an automated
Discovery Engine generating this kind of document, was considered and
deferred in the original `agentCodex` review — not adopted, see ADR-012 —
since `agentCodex` had no such engine and none was planned at the time.
That deferral no longer holds: Tr5-base ported the Discovery Engine (see
ADR-031) and wires it in automatically before every contract, so
`current_state` is now written from a freshly generated
`memory/CURRENT_STATE.md` rather than manual reading alone.)

### P7 — Establishing the actual current state precedes reasoning about what should change.
Status: Active
Source: Tr5 P5

No decision about what should change is made from memory or assumption.
The actual state of the relevant code and the public API is established
first — by reading it — before any requirement, contract, or fix is
proposed. (Operationally this is `AGENTS.md`'s "Read related files and the
public API before changing code"; this entry is the underlying reason that
rule exists, not a duplicate of it.)

### P8 — Every implementation begins with an explicit architectural intent.
Status: Active
Source: Tr5 P6

No code is written without a preceding contract that states why it is
needed, not only what it is. This is why every
`IMPLEMENTATION_CONTRACT_NNNN.md` has mandatory "Purpose" and "Intent"
fields, kept separate from the requirements themselves — the template
enforces the shape, this principle is the reason the shape exists.

### P9 — One decision, one source of truth — don't split it into separate human- and machine-facing artifacts before that split is actually needed.
Status: Active
Source: Tr5 P7 (generalized)

A human-readable representation and a machine-readable one can only
diverge in meaning if they are separate artifacts. Where possible, generate
both from a single source of truth instead of maintaining two files that
must be kept in sync by hand. This is why `contract_workflow.py` embeds the
`CONTRACT-META` JSON block directly inside the same `.md` file, generated
by the same `render_contract()` function from the same `Contract`
dataclass, instead of a separate `.json` package — divergence is
structurally impossible when there is only one file. If a real need for a
genuinely separate machine-facing artifact ever appears, that is a new
decision to make then, not a default to assume now (see P1).

### P10 — A disagreement between contract and implementation is a defect to resolve, not a matter of preference.
Status: Active
Source: Tr5 P8

If the actual implementation does not match what a contract's point
requires, that mismatch is a defect — it gets fixed, it is never treated as
an equally valid alternative reading. This is the reason implementation
review exists and is taken seriously: the reviewer checks every point
against its acceptance criteria, and any mismatch routes back to the
programmer as `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, not settled by preference.

This matters more here than in a single-pass setup, because the reviewer
was not the one who wrote the contract — it never checks its own work.
(Revised under Tr5-base decision 1: the `reviewer` now holds both review
gates rather than a separate architect running implementation review; the
independence this paragraph describes is preserved because the reviewer
never checks a contract it authored, and because decision 9 gives it a
fresh thread with no memory of the contract's own architecture review, so
even its own earlier verdict is re-derived from the record, not recalled.
See ADR-028.) The architecture review's findings and verdict (the
`# Architecture Review` rounds) are part of the same rendered contract
file the reviewer reads during implementation review, so they are
structurally available; the review command explicitly directs attention to
them (see `agents/reviewer/commands/review_contract.md`) so what was
actually accepted — not just the original point text in isolation — is
what the implementation is checked against.

### P11 — Validate a new structural decision on the smallest real case before generalizing it.
Status: Active
Source: Tr5 P9

A new pattern, tool, agent role, or structural convention is proven on the
smallest possible real case before it is generalized across the project.
Adding the `reviewer` role (ADR-003) is an example already behind us: it
was introduced as one concrete addition to the existing two-role workflow,
not designed upfront as a generic N-role framework. The same standard
applies to future structural additions — e.g. a future `coordinator`
profile should be piloted on one real case first, not designed in the
abstract.

### P12 — A contract's identity is permanent and independent of its changing content.
Status: Active
Source: Tr5 P10 (narrowed)

A contract's number identifies the decision itself, not a particular draft
of it. The number is assigned once, is never reused, and never changes —
not even when `revise_contract()` rewrites the requirements after
`ARCHITECTURE_CHANGES_REQUESTED`, and not across any number of review
rounds. This is why revision replaces a contract's content in place under
the same number instead of creating a new one, and why review history is
appended rather than overwriting — the file's identity persists through
every change to what it says.

### P13 — The programmer implements; it does not architect. A real gap is reported, not decided.
Status: Active
Source: Tr5 P11

An agent implementing a contract does not introduce abstractions,
features, or simplifications beyond what the contract specifies. If a
point leaves a real gap that requires an architectural decision — not just
a missing detail reasonably inferred from the contract and the existing
code — the programmer does not decide it. It implements only what is
unambiguous, describes the gap precisely in that point's note, and calls
it out in the overall summary so the reviewer sees it during
implementation review, instead of silently improvising. This is also why
the `programmer` profile's permissions are `edit`, not `full`, and why its
`ROLE.md` forbids direct edits to long-term memory.

### P14 — Process weight must match decision weight.
Status: Active
Source: Tr5 P12

The full contract pipeline exists to protect structural, hard-to-reverse
decisions. Small, reversible changes take the light path instead (see
`AGENTS.md` "Light path for small fixes", ADR-006). A process that taxes
every step, including trivial ones, eventually gets abandoned — and an
abandoned process protects nothing. This is why the light path exists at
all, not a workaround to the contract system but the other half of it.

### P15 — Standards are extracted from a working system, not invented in advance.
Status: Active
Source: Tr5 P13

A convention earns its place in this document by proving itself inside
real, observed work first — the constitutional layer stays minimal until
reality actually demands more. This is the method this migration itself
followed: P3 was deferred rather than adopted because no real case for it
exists yet (ADR-012), P10 was narrowed to only the part that actually
applies, and nothing was added "just in case."

_Tr5 P18 ("not every entity is a platform Artifact") was reviewed and not
adopted — see ADR-013. This closes the initial review of Tr5 P1-P13 and
P18. Future principles are still added the same way: appended above once
agreed, following the Revision Process above._

### P16 — A fake must be realistic enough not to manufacture failures a real dependency would never cause.
Status: Active
Source: Tr5 P22

A fake is necessary for safe isolation from real external systems (see
P4), but an unrealistic one can point that same isolation discipline at a
false conclusion. Tr5's own incident: a fake microphone stream that
returned data instantly (no delay) made a correctly-working client appear
to hang indefinitely — the tight, unpaced send loop a real microphone's
natural timing would never produce; a timing-accurate fake (matching the
real dependency's natural pacing, not just its interface) made the "hang"
disappear. Worth a specific check whenever a fake stands in for something
with real-world timing behavior (audio, network latency, hardware
polling): does the fake's *pace*, not just its *interface*, resemble the
real thing closely enough that a pass or failure means what it appears to
mean.

### P17 — Native/hardware library instances often need to be shared across threads, not created per-thread.
Status: Active
Source: Tr5 P23

Tr5's own incident: two threads each creating their own
`pyaudio.PyAudio()` instance — a reasonable-looking pattern when reading
either thread's code in isolation — caused a hard access violation,
because one thread's instance initialized while the other already had an
active stream mid-read. No amount of Python-level testing (mocks, fakes)
could have caught this: the failure is a native library's internal
thread-safety limitation, invisible until run against real hardware.
Fixed by sharing one instance across threads, created once and terminated
once. When wrapping a native/hardware library (audio, GPU, serial ports,
camera capture) across multiple threads, check the library's own guidance
for shared-vs-per-thread instantiation before assuming either is safe by
default — directly relevant to this template's own voice module (see
`tr5_base_implementation_plan.md` Phase 7), which wraps exactly this kind
of library.

_This completes the review of Tr5 P19-P25 into `PRINCIPLES.md` (Tr5-base
decision 6): P19→P2, P20→P3, P21→P4, P24→P5 were already adopted before
this bootstrap; P22→P16 and P23→P17 adopted here. P25 ("browser-only
globals need explicit stubs when testing frontend JS outside a browser")
was reviewed and not adopted — narrow to Tr5's `platform_shell` frontend,
which Tr5-base does not carry, and Tr5-base has no frontend JS of its own
yet; revisit if a real case appears (per P11/P15), not written in
speculatively. See ADR-032._

## Open Questions (Backlog)

These are known unresolved decisions. They are intentionally left open
until a real case forces the decision — per P11/P15.

- **Shared memory across every Architect of every project cloned from
  this template.** Raised during Tr5-base decision 9 (per-role memory
  model: only the architect keeps persistent memory; reviewer and
  programmer get a fresh thread with no memory). The question is
  whether an Architect's memory should ever be shared or pooled across
  separate projects that were each cloned from this same `Tr5-base`
  template — e.g. so a lesson learned by one project's Architect is
  available to another's. Not designed now: no second cloned project
  exists yet to validate the idea against, and each clone is meant to
  live its own independent life (ADR-020/ADR-028). Revisit once one
  project's own Architect memory has actually proven itself useful in
  practice, not before.
